# Simple program for the compiler

# Variable assignment
x = 10
y = 5

# Basic arithmetic
sum = x + y
diff = x - y

# Print statements
print("Hello World")
print(sum)
print(diff)

# Conditional statement
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")

# Simple loop with proper indentation
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
